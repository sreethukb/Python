'''This program or a mini-game is designed when you donâ€™t have anyone to play or you are under lockdown alone. There are a number of functions that this program 
requires so here is an overview of each.
--> a random function: to generate rock, paper, or scissors. 
--> valid function: to check the validity of the move.
--> result function: to declare the winner of the round.
--> scorekeeper: to keep track of the score. '''
